# EDA Amazon Books Reviews
==============================

### An exploratory analysis of the Amazon Book Reviews.

## Introduction
The general idea behind this research to identify and establish a pattern or a set of patterns and relationships 
among a plethora of features available within the acquired data. A thorough analysis is performed by using a 
multitude of tools and package using Python so that a set of statistical and/or machine learning models can 
be applied to accomplish better generalization.
